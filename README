NAME
    Avocado - A web anti-framework

SYNOPSIS
    Avocado is an anti-framework for web applications. It was written as an
    exercise in organizing a framework from scratch.

    I put avocado on my chili the night I started this. Yum.

    Don't use this -- definitely not for anything important.

    If you are masochistic, here you go. You were warned.

      use Plack::Runner;
      use Avocado;
  
      sub run {
        guacamole(@_);

        my $r = request();
    
        body(sprintf("The current page is: %s", $r->path_info));

        return response();
      }
  
      my $psgi = Plack::Runner->new;
      $psgi->run(\&run);
